## Getting Started

To get started, you will need Git installed on your local machine. If you haven't installed Git yet, follow the instructions on [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-command-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```bash
   cd github-command-practice
   ```

3. Create your own branch for practice:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-practice-branch
   ```

4. Start experimenting with Git commands!

## GitHub Commands

Here are some of the key Git commands you can practice:

- **Clone the repository**:  
  ```bash
  git clone <repo-url>
  ```

- **Check the repository status**:  
  ```bash
  git status
  ```

- **Add changes to the staging area**:  
  ```bash
  git add <file-name>
  ```

- **Commit your changes**:  
  ```bash

  ```

- **Push changes to GitHub**:

## Branching and Merging

Practice creating, switching between branches, and merging them:

- **Create a new branch**:  
  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```

  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```

- **Merge branches**:  
  ```bash
  git checkout <target-branch>
  git merge <branch-name>
